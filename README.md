# Charity

In this project, I will apply supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help a Charity identify people most likely to donate to their cause. I will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. We will then evaluate several supervised learners on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. We will optimize the model present it as your solution to the Charity.
